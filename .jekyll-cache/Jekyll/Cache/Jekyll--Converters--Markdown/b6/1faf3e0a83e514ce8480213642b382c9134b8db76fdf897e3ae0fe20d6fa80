I"p<p>I found this bug in Razer Cortex Service vesion <code class="highlighter-rouge">7.3.23.124</code> .By default <code class="highlighter-rouge">RzKLService.exe</code> runs with system privileges, and it executes <code class="highlighter-rouge">RazerCortex.exe</code> with administrator privileges but the way its load this binary i.e <code class="highlighter-rouge">RazerCortex.exe</code> is vulnerable to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unquoted Search path Vulnerability</code>. So any attacker to can executes its binary which is places in these two paths:-
<code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Program.exe</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Program Files (x86)\Razer\Razer.exe</code> which is not present. So if an attacker places their malicious binary at this place, then whenever the  user logged in it, attacker binary executes with administrator privilege.</p>
