I"O<p>I found this bug in Razer Cortex Service vesion `	7.3.23.124<code class="highlighter-rouge"> .By default </code>RzKLService.exe<code class="highlighter-rouge"> this runs with system privileges, and it executes </code>RazerCortex.exe<code class="highlighter-rouge"> with administrator privileges but the way its load this exe i.e </code>RazerCortex.exe<code class="highlighter-rouge"> is vulnerable to </code>Unquoted Search path Vulnerability<code class="highlighter-rouge">. So any attacker to can executes its binary which is places in these two places:-
</code>C:\Program.exe<code class="highlighter-rouge"> and </code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Razer\Razer.exe` which is not present. So if an attacker places their malicious binary at this place, then whenever the  user logged in it, attacker binary executes with administrator privilege.</p>
